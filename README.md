# React + Vite

As a front-end student who switch to back-end in his first job, one of my goals is back to my front-end days and learn about the "modern" web developing. 

This is a simple static page made to learn React basics :)

In this project I learn:
- How to setup React with Vite
- How React Render works
- JSX 
- React custom components
- Styling 
- Project organization
